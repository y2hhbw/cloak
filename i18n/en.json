  "security_warning2": "Never share steganographic images containing sensitive information on social media or public platforms, as image compression might destroy the hidden data.",
  "security_warning3": "Always keep multiple backups of your crypto wallet information through different secure methods.",
  "security_warning4": "For maximum security, use this tool on an offline computer when hiding sensitive financial information.",
  "security_warning5": "The tool has a limited capacity for hiding data based on the image size. Larger images can store more data.",
  "best_practices_title": "Security Best Practices",
  "best_practice1_title": "Choose the Right Image",
  "best_practice1": "Use high-resolution images with complex patterns or many colors to better hide your data. Prefer PNG format over JPEG, as JPEG compression can destroy hidden data. Avoid using popular or recognizable images that might attract attention.",
  "best_practice2_title": "Password Protection",
  "best_practice2": "Always use strong, unique passwords when encrypting sensitive information. Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.",
  "best_practice3_title": "Secure Storage and Transmission",
  "best_practice3": "Store steganographic images on encrypted drives or secure cloud storage with strong passwords. When transmitting steganographic images, use encrypted channels like Signal, ProtonMail, or other end-to-end encrypted services. Consider using a different transmission channel for the password than the one used for the image. Delete metadata from images before encoding sensitive information to remove potential identifying information.",
  "best_practice4_title": "Avoid Compression",
  "best_practice4": "Never upload steganographic images to social media or messaging platforms that compress images, as this will likely destroy the hidden data.",
  "best_practice5_title": "Multiple Backups",
  "best_practice5": "Always maintain multiple backups of your sensitive information using different methods, not just steganography.",
  "best_practice6_title": "Additional Protection Layers",
  "best_practice6": "Always use the password protection feature for sensitive information. Consider encrypting your message with PGP or other encryption tools before hiding it in an image. For cryptocurrency keys, use BIP39 passphrase (25th word) as an additional security layer. Regularly change the images you use for storing sensitive information.",
  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq1_question": "How much data can I hide in an image?",
  "faq1_answer": "The amount of data depends on the image size. As a rule of thumb, you can hide approximately 10% of the image size in bytes. For example, a 1MB image can hide about 100KB of text.",
  "faq2_question": "Will the image look different after hiding data?",
  "faq2_answer": "When using LSB steganography, changes are usually imperceptible to the human eye. However, technical analysis can detect modifications. The DCT and Patchwork methods offer better resistance to detection.",
  "faq3_question": "What image formats work best?",
  "faq3_answer": "PNG is recommended as it uses lossless compression. JPEG is not ideal as its compression algorithm can destroy hidden data. BMP and TIFF also work well but result in larger file sizes.",
  "faq4_question": "Is steganography the same as encryption?",
  "faq4_answer": "No. Steganography hides the existence of data, while encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable. This tool offers both: steganography to hide data and optional password protection to encrypt it.",
  "faq5_question": "Can I hide files other than text?",
  "faq5_answer": "This tool is designed for text only. To hide other file types, you would need to convert them to text (e.g., using Base64 encoding) before hiding them.",
  "faq6_question": "Why does decoding fail sometimes?",
  "faq6_answer": "Decoding can fail if: the image was compressed after encoding (e.g., by social media), the wrong password was used, the image doesn't contain hidden data, or you selected the wrong steganography algorithm.",
  "troubleshooting_title": "Troubleshooting Guide",
  "issue1_title": "Encoding fails or produces corrupted images",
  "issue1_solution": "Try using a different image, preferably a PNG with higher resolution. Ensure your message isn't too large for the image capacity.",
  "issue2_title": "Decoding returns gibberish or no data",
  "issue2_solution": "Verify you're using the correct password (if one was set). Try the \"Auto Detect\" algorithm option. Ensure the image hasn't been modified or compressed since encoding.",
  "issue3_title": "Browser crashes during encoding/decoding",
  "issue3_solution": "This may happen with very large images or messages. Try using smaller images or breaking your message into smaller parts.",
  "issue4_title": "Recovery phrase validation fails",
  "issue4_solution": "Ensure all words are spelled correctly and are from the BIP39 wordlist. Check that you've selected the correct phrase length (12 or 24 words).",
  "invalid_bip39_word": "Not a valid BIP39 word",
  "valid_mnemonic": "Valid {{count}}-word mnemonic",
  "fill_all_mnemonic_inputs": "Please fill all mnemonic word inputs",
  "contains_invalid_bip39_words": "Contains invalid BIP39 words",
  "mnemonic_must_contain": "Mnemonic must contain {{count}} words",
  "issue5_title": "Downloaded image doesn't contain the hidden message",
  "issue5_solution": "Make sure you downloaded the image after encoding, not the original. Try encoding again and test decoding before sharing the image.",
